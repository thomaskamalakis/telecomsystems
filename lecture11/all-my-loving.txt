Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send All My Loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
the lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home ev'ry day
And I'll send All My Loving to you
All My Loving I will send to you
All My Loving, darling I'll be true
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home ev'ry day
And I'll send All My Loving to you
All My Loving I will send to you
All My Loving darling I'll be True
All My Loving All My Loving ooh
All My Loving I will send to you
